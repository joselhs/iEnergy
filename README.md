# iEnergy
iEnergy is the result of my End-Of-Degree Project. It's a WebApp built using Play! Framework with Java. 
iEnergy helps you save money on the electric bill by showing you the electricity prices for the day after, 
letting you compare different company rates and also, if you upload your bill (CSV format), 
it gives you recommendations (naive ones) based on your habits. You can find the full document of the project (in Spanish) in the following [link](https://mega.nz/file/AORmRQDS#GStG6KzUdLgoR0EPjyyG_18sucDvHne91ETWgFVBOoo).

## How to run it
To run the WebApp in a local environment, you should follow the next steps:

- Run the MySQL Server (you can find a database dump covering from 2014 to 2016 on the following [link](https://mega.nz/file/ZXBglIhR#2Hp3HDzqFGAXqcY97qakC56INeVqTiVbzhD-LpbOChc).)
- Go to the root directory and type 'play run' (you need to have Play! Framework in root too. Download it and unzip it. You can find my version on the following [link](https://mega.nz/file/tfBgGCjS#d9z_uWMWWvbdB1jXIqhmAF60bvushlsM_AErwAEdH6o).)
- When the server is running, the WebApp will be running on http://localhost:9123
